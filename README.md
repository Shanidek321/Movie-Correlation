# Movie-Correlation
<h3> Using Movies Dataset from Kaggle that includes information about Movies.</h3>
<h4> This project was done in Jupyter Notebook using Python exclusively.</h4>
<h4> Things I did in this analysis:</h4>
- Data Cleaning: I've arranged the dates so they're more easily used and removed duplicates.
<br>
- Checking the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings
<br>
- After checking, I found out there is a direct correlation between budget spent and the gross earnings.
<br>
- Checking the correlation between a company and it's gross earnings and there was no correlation.
<br>
- Found out votes and budget had the highest correlation to gross earnings

<h3>To summarize, I found out there is a direct correlation between budget and votes to gross earnings
and from that we learn that if we spend more and try and cultivate more votes, it has a positive effect on the gross earnings.</h3>
